# RedDeadBlender2
WIP Blender plugin for working with model formats from Red Dead Redemption 2.
Utilizes [LibDrawable](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/libdrawable) via the Python bindings generated with [PyLibDrawable](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/PyLibDrawable).

## Requirements
This add-on requires the `pylibdrawable` Python module. Ensure it is installed and available to Blender's Python interpreter, or include the module alongside the add-on files. Installation instructions are available in the [PyLibDrawable repository](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/PyLibDrawable).
